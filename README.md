# Build-a-Multi-Agent-App-with-ADK-Agent-Engine-AlloyDB-
Built a Multi-Agent Application using the Agents Development Kit (ADK), Agent Engine, and AlloyDB as part of a full hands-on codelab! In this project, agents collaborated to generate a smart renovation proposal document, integrated with AlloyDB and deployed via Cloud Shell. 
🚀 Just built my first Multi-Agent App using the Agents Development Kit (ADK), Agent Engine, and AlloyDB!
Super excited to share what I’ve been working on! 💡

As part of this hands-on codelab, I:
✅ Developed multiple agents using ADK
✅ Connected them via the Agent Engine to collaborate on a common task
✅ Integrated with AlloyDB for seamless, managed database storage
✅ Deployed and tested the app in Cloud Shell with real-time feedback
✅ Stored generated results securely in Cloud Storage

💬 This lab was not just about writing code—it was about designing intelligent agents that communicate, delegate, and deliver value as a team.

🎯 Use Case: I implemented a smart renovation proposal generator that:

Collects user inputs

Coordinates agent interactions (writer, reviewer, formatter)

Outputs a polished document and stores it in the cloud

🛠️ Tools Used:

ADK (Agents Development Kit)

Agent Engine (for orchestration)

AlloyDB (PostgreSQL compatible)

Google Cloud Shell & Cloud Storage

Big thanks to #GoogleCloud and the #CodeVipasana Season 10 team for enabling this journey!
